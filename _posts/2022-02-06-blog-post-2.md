Starting a new church can be a daunting task. However, when a group of Christ followers feel called by God to spread the Gospel, they know they must answer. That's exactly what happened with the team at <a href="https://waymaker.faith/">Waymaker Church</a>.

Waymaker Church started in Fall 2021 when a team of young adults from a small group felt called to spread the Gospel among their Chinese neighbors in the northeast of the Greater Seattle Area. They fasted and prayed together every week, seeking God's vision for their mission. As they continued to pray, God's vision for them became clearer and clearer. During this time, they found that six members of the small group had decided to be baptized, strengthening their faith to start a new journey with God.

As they continued to seek a place to gather, the leaders of <a href="https://evergreenchurch.tv/">Evergreen Church</a> in Bothell, WA extended a warm welcome to them. Evergreen Church leaders had also been praying for evangelicalism in the Chinese community, and they saw this as a divine connection.

On February 6th, 2022, Waymaker Church held its first Sunday worship service in the "Uptown Room" of Evergreen Church. With 65 brothers and sisters in attendance, they began their journey to make a way in the wilderness and streams in the wasteland.

The name "Waymaker" comes from the song "Way Maker" by Sinach. The song's lyrics reflect the team's journey to start the church and the promise of God to make a way where there seems to be no way. They believe that God is always making a way for His people, even in the darkest of times.

As Isaiah 43:18-19 says, "Forget the former things; do not dwell on the past. See, I am doing a new thing! Now it springs up; do you not perceive it? I am making a way in the wilderness and streams in the wasteland." Waymaker Church is embracing this truth and believing that God will make a way for them as they seek to spread the Gospel in their community.

Waymaker Church's mission is to "make disciples who make disciples." They believe that the Gospel is for everyone, and their desire is to see people come to know Christ and grow in their relationship with Him. They believe that making disciples is not a one-time event but a lifelong journey of following Christ and helping others do the same.

Waymaker Church's vision is to create a community of believers who are united in their love for Christ and their passion for spreading the Gospel. They believe that the church is not a building but a people who gather together to worship, learn, and serve.

Starting a new church is never easy, but Waymaker Church is trusting in God to guide them every step of the way. They believe that God has called them to make a difference in their community, and they are excited to see what He will do through their obedience.

In conclusion, Waymaker Church began with a team of Christ followers who answered God's call to spread the Gospel in their Chinese community. They believe that God is always making a way, even in the wilderness, and they are trusting in Him to guide them as they seek to make disciples who make disciples. With their focus on unity, worship, learning, and serving, Waymaker Church is poised to make a lasting impact in their community for Christ.
