Love is in the air, and when it's time to take that big step, nothing is more exciting than the perfect proposal. For me, that moment came on Thanksgiving Day in 2021, at my friend's house in Bothell, WA. I proposed to my girlfriend, Macy Lee, and I'm thrilled to say that she said yes!

As I look back on that day, I can't help but feel grateful for all the people who made it possible. My church, lab, and school friends all played a huge role in helping me plan, decorate, and capture the moment. But before I dive into the details of that unforgettable day, let me tell you a little bit about Macy and me.

Macy and I met at a Chinese church in Seattle, and from the moment we locked eyes, I knew there was something special about her. We quickly became friends and then started dating. We've been together for four years now, and I knew that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her.

Planning the Proposal

As the day of the proposal approached, I knew I wanted to do something special for Macy. I wanted to create a memory that we could cherish for the rest of our lives. So I decided to make a "Follow Me To" video series with her, which would lead up to the proposal.

For those who don't know, a "Follow Me To" video is a popular trend on social media, where a person films themselves holding their partner's hand and leading them to different places. I had been collecting footage of our adventures for years, and I knew that the video would be the perfect way to set the scene for the proposal.

On the day of the proposal, I invited Macy to my friend's house, where we had planned a Thanksgiving dinner with our closest friends. Before dinner, I first went inside the house to get prepared, and Macy came a bit later. As she stood in the beautifully decorated room, we played the "Follow Me To" video on the television.

The Proposal

After the video ended, I sang a song that I had written for Macy. The lyrics were all about how much I loved her and how I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her. As I finished the song, I got down on one knee and pulled out the ring. "Macy Lee, will you marry me?" I asked. And she said yes!

The Aftermath

After the proposal, we had the Thanksgiving dinner with our friends, who prepared a beautiful cake and a great potluck meal to celebrate. It was a night that we will never forget, and we owe it all to the love and support of our friends.

In conclusion, proposing to Macy Lee on Thanksgiving Day 2021 was a dream come true. The "Follow Me To" video series and the song I wrote for her added a personal touch to the proposal, and I couldn't have done it without the help of our friends. We're both excited for what the future holds, and we're grateful for the memories that we've created along the way.
