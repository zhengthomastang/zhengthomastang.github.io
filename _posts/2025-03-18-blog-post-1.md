Iâ€™m excited to share that our team at NVIDIA has officially released the [**Physical AI Smart Spaces** dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/PhysicalAI-SmartSpaces) as part of the [**Open Physical AI Dataset**](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/open-physical-ai-dataset/) initiative, announced during **GTC 2025**. This dataset supports **Tracks 1** of the **AI City Challenge 2024 & 2025**, helping researchers push the boundaries of real-time, multi-camera spatial AI.

As a lead contributor, I helped drive the creation and integration of this large-scale synthetic datasetâ€”designed specifically for **multi-target multi-camera (MTMC) tracking**, **3D occupancy prediction**, and **smart infrastructure simulation**. It is one of the most comprehensive synthetic datasets ever released for spatial AI, capturing warehouse, factory, and public space scenarios with fine-grained annotations and synchronized multi-view video.

Built with NVIDIA Omniverse and aligned with our Metropolis AI workflows, the dataset enables the development of robust computer vision systems for real-world deployment. From training deep learning models to validating digital twin applications, Physical AI Smart Spaces serves as a benchmark-ready resource for cutting-edge research and development.

Weâ€™re proud to empower the global research community with open tools and high-quality data. Whether you're developing advanced trackers, occupancy estimators, or large-scale analytics systems, this dataset is built to accelerate your innovation.
