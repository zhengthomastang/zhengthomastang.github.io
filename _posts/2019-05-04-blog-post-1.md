As a software developer, I love to participate in hackathons to test my skills and knowledge, as well as to collaborate with fellow tech enthusiasts. One of the most exciting hackathons I have participated in is [Code for the Kingdom (C4TK) - Seattle 2019](https://codeforthekingdom.org/seattle-hackathon-2019.html), where my team won the People's Choice Award.

During the 24-hour hackathon, my team and I developed an app that generates scripture art for users. We used Python with Tk GUI to create the app, which generates images with Bible verses that are randomly selected. We wanted to ensure that the text in the images would have high contrast against the background, so we came up with a unique solution.

To determine the complement color in the HSV color space for the text, we computed the mean color of the background. By finding the complement color, we ensured that the scripture text was easy to read and stood out in the image. This algorithm helped us to create a visually appealing app that users would enjoy.

Our team was thrilled when we won the People's Choice Award at the C4TK - Seattle 2019. We were proud of our accomplishment and enjoyed working together to develop the app. We learned a lot during the hackathon and were grateful for the opportunity to showcase our skills.

If you are interested in learning more about our app or would like to use it yourself, you can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/blackmacy/Scripture_Art). We hope that you find it useful and enjoyable.
