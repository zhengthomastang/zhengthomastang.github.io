On a beautiful day in Seremban, Malaysia, Macy Lee and I had our dream wedding. It was a day filled with love, joy, and the presence of God that we will cherish forever.

We had our wedding at the One Destiny Restaurant in Seremban, which provided the perfect ambiance for our special day. We are forever grateful to Macy's family for their unwavering love and support in preparing for our wedding. They made everything so magnificent and elegant, and we could not have done it without them.

We were surrounded by our loved ones, who traveled from near and far to celebrate with us. We felt so blessed to have all the guests there to witness our union and to share in our happiness. We were especially touched by our church friends in the United States, who sent their blessings through a lovely video. Even though they couldn't be there with us in person, their love and support were felt throughout the day.

During the ceremony, I sang the song I wrote for Macy again, which expressed the depth of my love for her. It was a special moment that we will never forget. We also felt the presence of God with us throughout the ceremony. We prayed together, and it was a beautiful reminder of the love and commitment that we were making to each other.

Our wedding day was a dream come true, and we are grateful for everyone who made it possible. It was a perfect representation of our love for each other and a beautiful beginning to our journey as husband and wife. We cannot wait to see what the future holds for us, and we look forward to growing together in love and faith.

In conclusion, our wedding day in Malaysia was a beautiful and unforgettable experience. We are so blessed to have each other and to be surrounded by such wonderful family and friends. We are forever grateful for the love and support we received on our special day, and we cannot wait to start our new life together.
