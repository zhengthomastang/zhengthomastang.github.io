I was elected to be a [Session Elder](https://www.upc.org/connect/leadership/elders/) of the [University Presbyterian Church (UPC)](https://www.upc.org/). 

I still remember the feeling of excitement and awe when I received the news that I had been elected to be a Session Elder of the [University Presbyterian Church (UPC)](https://www.upc.org/). It was an honor that came with great responsibility and a strong sense of duty to serve my fellow members and the church community as a whole.

For those who may not be familiar with the role, elders are active members of the church who serve in government, leadership, and ministry. We are persons of faith, dedication, and good judgment, nominated and elected by the congregation. As elders, we serve on the church’s governing body (called Session), take part in planning committees, assist in worship, serve communion, and help the pastors nurture, teach, and encourage the congregation.

Becoming an elder is not a decision to be taken lightly. It requires a strong commitment to the church and its mission, as well as a willingness to put in the time and effort needed to fulfill the responsibilities of the role. It also demands a deep sense of humility and a recognition that we are not perfect, but rather are called to serve as servants of the church and its people.

One of the most fulfilling aspects of serving as an elder is the opportunity to work alongside other committed members of the congregation, who share a passion for serving the church and its community. Together, we bring our unique perspectives and talents to the table, working collaboratively to make decisions that benefit the church as a whole.

Through my experience as an elder, I have learned that serving the church is not just a duty, but a privilege. It has given me the opportunity to deepen my faith, connect with others in the community, and make a positive impact on the world around me. It has also challenged me to grow as a person, to develop new skills, and to embrace new experiences and perspectives.

As I reflect on my time as an elder, I am grateful for the trust and support of my fellow members, and for the opportunity to serve a community that has given me so much. I encourage anyone who feels called to serve the church in this way to consider taking on the role of elder – it is truly a calling that can change your life, and the lives of those around you.
