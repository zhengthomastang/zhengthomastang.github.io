# <i class="fa fa-cog fa-spin fa-fw"></i> Bio #

Dr. Zheng (Thomas) Tang is currently a Senior Data Science Engineer of [Metropolis](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/intelligent-video-analytics-platform/) at [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/) (2021~). Dr. Tang was previously an Applied Scientist of [Amazon One](https://one.amazon.com/) at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) (2019~2021). He received his Ph.D. degree in [Electrical & Computer Engineering (ECE)](https://www.ece.uw.edu/) from the [University of Washington (UW)](http://www.washington.edu/) in 2019. 

His research interests include intelligent transportation systems, multi-/single-camera object tracking, re-identification, pose estimation, action recognition, camera calibration, synthetic data generation, biometric identification, and other topics in computer vision and machine learning. He has 4 filed U.S. patents and 19 publications in peer-reviewed journals and conference proceedings in these areas. He has been an Associate Editor (AE) (2021~) for [<i>IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology</i> (T-CSVT)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=76) and an Organizing Committee Member (2020~) for the [AI City Challenge Workshops](https://www.aicitychallenge.org/) in conjunction with CVPR. He is also an Area Chair of <a href="https://2021.ieeemlsp.org/">MLSP 2021</a>. As a reviewer, he frequently serves for academic journals and international conferences, such as IJCV, T-PAMI, T-IP, T-MM, T-CSVT, T-ITS, NeurIPS, CVPR, ICCV, ICASSP, ICME, etc. Dr. Tang received the Best AE Award of T-CSVT in 2021. 

The team he led achieved rank #1 in Track 1 (Traffic Flow Analysis) and Track 3 (Multi-camera Vehicle Detection and Reidentification) at the [2nd AI City Challenge Workshop](https://www.aicitychallenge.org/2018-ai-city-challenge/) in CVPR 2018. His paper was a finalist of 2 Best Student Paper Awards at [ICPR 2016](https://iapr.org/archives/icpr2016/site.1.html).
