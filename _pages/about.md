Dr. Zheng (Thomas) Tang is currently a Senior Deep Learning Engineer on the [Metropolis](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/intelligent-video-analytics-platform/) team at [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/) (2021–present). He was previously an Applied Scientist on the [Amazon One](https://one.amazon.com/) team at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) (2019–2021). He earned his Ph.D. in [Electrical & Computer Engineering (ECE)](https://www.ece.uw.edu/) from the [University of Washington (UW)](http://www.washington.edu/) in 2019.

His research interests span intelligent transportation systems, multi-/single-camera object tracking, re-identification, pose estimation, action recognition, camera calibration, synthetic data generation, biometric identification, and related areas in computer vision and machine learning. He holds 9 filed U.S. patents and has published 25 peer-reviewed papers in top journals and conferences. Dr. Tang is the Tech Lead of the [Metropolis Multi-Camera Tracking AI Workflow](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/ai-workflows/multi-camera-tracking/), integrated into the Mega Omniverse Blueprint and showcased during CES’25 and GTC’25 keynotes by NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang. 

He currently serves as a Senior Area Editor (SAE) (2025–present) for the [*IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology* (T-CSVT)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=76) and as an Organizing Committee Lead (2020–present) for the [AI City Challenges](https://www.aicitychallenge.org/) at CVPR. He is also an Area Chair for [ACM MM 2024](https://2024.acmmm.org/) and [MLSP 2021](https://2021.ieeemlsp.org/). As a reviewer, Dr. Tang regularly serves top-tier journals and conferences including IJCV, T-PAMI, T-IP, T-MM, T-CSVT, T-ITS, NeurIPS, CVPR, ICCV, ICASSP, and ICME. He received the T-CSVT Best Associate Editor Award in 2021.

He led the winning team in Track 1 (Traffic Flow Analysis) and Track 3 (Multi-Camera Vehicle Detection and Re-Identification) at the [2nd AI City Challenge Workshop](https://www.aicitychallenge.org/2018-ai-city-challenge/) at CVPR 2018. His research was also recognized as a finalist for two Best Student Paper Awards at [ICPR 2016](https://iapr.org/archives/icpr2016/site.1.html).
